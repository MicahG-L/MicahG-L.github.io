Data visualization projects and other explorations in the world of data.
My name is Micah and I'm a Journalism and Sociology/Anthropology double major at Lehigh University. I primarily use data to work with media and technology and analyze trends in various aspects of life. This is my portfolio for visualizations and other projects that detail my journeys with data patterns and frequencies.
